Diagram explaining project and repository context and how they are integrated

Branching Strategy to be used within each project :
I will be using GitHub Flow Branch Strategy - The gitHub flow branching strategy is relatively simple workflow that allows small teams or  web application/products that don't require supporting multiple version s , to expendicture their work.

 use of a .gitignore file within each project
 gitignore can be used in Git with the help of following steps:
 Step 1: Open your terminal/cmd and change your directory to the folder where your files are located. You can use ” ls -a” command to view its contents.
 Step 2: Create .gitignore File inside the project folder.
 Step 3: Write the name of the files you want to ignore in the .gitignore text file. Each file name should be written in a new line .
 
 Never store credentials and sensitive data on GitHub:
GitHub’s purpose is to host code repositories. Beyond the permissions you set on your account, there is no other method of security that will ensure that your secret keys, private credentials, and sensitive data remain within a controlled and secured environment.
