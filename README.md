#Diagram explaining project and repository context and how they are integrated

#Branching Strategy to be used within each project :
I will be using GitHub Flow Branch Strategy - The gitHub flow branching strategy is relatively simple workflow that allows small teams or  web application/products that don't require supporting multiple version s , to expendicture their work.

 #use of a .gitignore file within each project
gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo.

#explain thestorage of credentials and sensitiveinformation
Never store credentials and sensitive data on GitHub:
GitHubâ€™s purpose is to host code repositories. Beyond the permissions you set on your account, there is no other method of security that will ensure that your secret keys, private credentials, and sensitive data remain within a controlled and secured environment.
